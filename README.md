A chess program in haskell with the following features:

 - Supports two players
 - Enforces rules
    - Pieces can only move to legal spaces
    - When pieces are taken they are accounted for
    - En Passant rules (eventually)
    - Pawn promotion
 - Board is drawn with terminal output
 - Maybe a simple AI to play against you. Sounds like a fun project
